I am learning how to use GitHub to manage my projects.
I practice basic commands like add, commit and push to build confidence.
I upload small projects so I can track my progress over time.
I explore branches and learn how to fix mistakes with simple commands.
I use GitHub to keep my code organized and version controlled.
I try new features like pull requests and issues to understand real workflows.
I experiment with different files so I get comfortable with updates.
I learn by doing, and GitHub helps me see every step I take.
I use GitHub as a space to grow my skills and share my work.
I improve a little each day by practicing and pushing new things.
